<h1>Borscht</h1>

<h2 id="smallheadline">The Greatest Soup You Will Ever Taste</h2>

<div class="wrapper"> <p class="intro"> <span class="bold-names"> Julia Hablak </span>(Bryn Mawr College 2021)
  and <span class="bold-names">Zoé Hommerich</span> (Davidson Collge 2023) both study Russian and enjoy culture,
  food and cooking. This Russian-loving pair wanted to share an easy recipe for borscht that anyone can follow!
  Although borscht originally originated from modern day Ukraine, the ingredients used for an authentic Russian borscht
  are very different from the ingredients used in the original Ukrainian soup. Until the late 17th century, the soup
  spread around Slavic countries while being modified to reflect regional crops as well as the tastes of the regional
  nobility. By the end of the 17th century, the name borscht was simply used as an umbrella term for a series of similar
  sour tasting soups. The first version of red Russian borscht, adopting its bright red colouring from added beetroot,
  is believed to have been be created by Ukrainians living under Russian rule in the early 18th century.
  Potateos and tomatoes were added during the the early 19th century through Western European influence.
